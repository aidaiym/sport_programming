To show that a function parameter is passed by
reference, an ampersand symbol (&) is placed after the
parameter type in the function prototype; the same
designation is used in the list of parameter types in the
function header. For example, the declaration of int
&count in the function header can be read as "count is
a reference to int".



To have a function with multiple outputs, we have to
use pass by reference.


References: A reference variable is an alias, that is, another name for an already existing variable. A reference, like a pointer, is also implemented by storing the address of an object.
