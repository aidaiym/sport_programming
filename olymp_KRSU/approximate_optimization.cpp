Three famous scientists Voktaysed, Vokiruy and Veidafin decided to help well-known brainy creature Rotsor to pass exams. 
Exams were on a very interesting and useful subject - Approximate Optimization. 
The problem was to write a program that behaves like the one written by Cheetah (who gave only EXE file running away for playing Civilization III).
 As Cheetah's mind is not so powerful Rotsor believes that Cheetah could write only a program evaluating some polynomial. 
 He is also sure that the polynomial degree is at most four (5 is too much for Cheetah). 
 Help the scientists to help Rotsor and write the desired program. 
 Remember that Rotsor is too lazy and the scientists are too busy so the only hope is on you.

Input
On the first line of the input you will be given number of test cases T (no greater than 100). 
T following lines will be numbers for evaluation (in range [-1000; 1000])

Output
Your program should produce T lines of output. Each line is the evaluation of the polynomial and should be same as the result of Cheetah's program. 
As was already said Cheetah's program evaluates polynomial of the form f(x) = A*x^4 + B*x^3 + C*x^2 + D*x + E. 
Print the values of f(x) with precision of 3 digits.
